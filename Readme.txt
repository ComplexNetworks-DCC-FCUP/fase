## Version Information
FaSE Version 0.3 - Launched March 8 2014
FaSE Version 0.4 - To be Launched

## Compilation and Usage
To compile the Source Code use the `make` command (at least on Linux).
If you wish to cleanup extra compilation files run the command `make clean`.

To use the FaSE software run `./FASE -h` to display a small help information
with instructions on what arguments should be provided.

Main Settings: `./FASE -s <Subgraph Size> -i <input file> [arguments...]`

All commands:

    -h : Displays this help information
	-s <Integer> : Subgraph Size
	-i <Filename> : Name of input file (Format in Readme)
	-d : Directed Subgraph (Default undirected)
	-o : Name of output file (Default is stdout)
	-dt : Detailed Result (Displays all subgraph types and occurrences)
	-z : Use 0-based input (Suitable for input files starting at node 0)
	-tm : Use Adjacency Matrix LS-Labeling (Default is Adjacency List Labeling)
	-l : Use Adjacency List Only (Suitable for Large Scale or large networks [>10^5 nodes])
	-q : Ignore arguments and prompt input

## Input Information
The inputed networks should be in an edge list format, meaning that the input
file should only contain lines with information about an edge, starting with
node 1 or 0 (can be specified in the arguments) and with all edges from 0/1
to `<Number of edges> - 1 / <Number of edges>` being used.

## Folder Information
The main folder contains all source files from the FaSE Source Code, this Read Me
file and two folders. The "nauty" folder contains the code from Brendan McKay's
Nauty algorithm for isomorphism tests. The "Networks" folder contains the used
networks in the process of testing the FaSE algorithm, organized by "Undirected"
and "Directed" folders straightforwardly in .edges files as described above (1-based).

## Graphlets Information
Under development

## Extra Information
The Source Code was developed and tested on a Linux environment, however it
should work on other OSs too.

This Source Code was developed along the following articles:

* ASONAM'2013 -http://asonam.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/ : Pedro Paredes and Pedro Ribeiro - Towards a Faster
Network-Centric Subgraph Census: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2492517.2492535.
* (Submitted to) SNAM - https://www.springer.com/computer/database+management+%26+information+retrieval/journal/13278 : Pedro Paredes and Pedro Ribeiro - FaSE: Fast Exact and Approximate Subgraph Census

This software uses the nauty program version 2.4 by Brendan McKay. Therefore, nauty's
license restrictions apply to the usage of FaSE.

## Authors
The original source code of FaSE was created by Pedro
Paredes and Pedro Ribeiro from CRACS & INESC-TEC DCC-FCUP,
Universidade do Porto, Portugal.

The work for graphlets was developed by David Apar√≠cio, Pedro Paredes
and Pedro Ribeiro from CRACS & INESC-TEC DCC-FCUP, Universidade do
Porto, Portugal.
